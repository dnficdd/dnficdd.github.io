巧用绕口令教学英语音标
       “万丈高楼平地起”，是说地基对于建筑物的重要性，而构筑英语殿堂的基石则是英语音标，学英语的目的就是为了说英语，用英语。一方面，有些人尽管笔试成绩 不错，但却羞于启齿说英语，或者说出的英语令人难以听懂。究其原因，是英语音标没掌握。另一方面，大多数英语单词的拼写和单词的音标都遵循读音规则，因 此，只要掌握了读音规则，并不断总结单词拼写与其音标之间的联系，就能做到看见单词就能读出来，能说出来的单词就会写。总之，掌握好语音，不仅对于练就一 口标准的英语口语很关键，而且对于记忆英语单词也有很大帮助。

       那么，如何读准音标呢?

       传统的方法是依照教材练口形，根据录音模仿发音。单纯这样的练习，一则单调乏味，二则缺乏对比，学习效果较差，很多人往往半途而废。传统教学中把容易混淆 的音标分组，进行对比练习，虽有效果，但因无相应的语言环境，也显得枯燥，难以把握。笔者在多年的英语教学工作中，把含有某个音标或某几个音标的多个单词 编成绕口令，教给学生。教学实践中，学生们觉得既生动有趣，又新颖独特，记忆深刻。枯燥的发音练习顿时生动活泼，音标的读音在不知不觉中得到强化，教学效 果明显提高。现将绕口令教学法的要点介绍如下：

         一、发挥绕口令的强化练习作用

        编一个绕口令，让个别难以发准的音标多次出习在一个或几个句子中，朗读时反复检查自己的口型使口腔习惯于该音的准确位置。若再次碰到此音，口腔便很快滑到 该音的准确位置。此谓单音强化练习如有人常把He smiles读成He smells，就是没有掌握［ai］的正确读音。不妨采用如下绕口令对［ai］的音进行强化训练：

    I like to ride my light white bike，and fly a white light kite with my wife．(我喜欢在晚上月光下沿河边和我量子边骑着那白色的轻型车边放白色的轻风筝。)

    二、发挥绕口令的对比作用

    绕口令的突出优点是进行对比练习。把两个豉多个相近的音素放在一起，让学生在朗读时进行比较，提高发音器官的适应性。特别是在长元音和短元音的训练中能使 学生有效的区分长音和短音，效果突出。例如，很多人认为［i］是长元音［i：］的短读。实际上，虽然［i］和［i：］都是舌前部抬高，但［i］的发声通道 要比［i：］大得多。用下面的绕口令进行对比训练。

     可快速掌握它们的发声特点：

    Bill was beating a big beast with his big fist，and his big rist was badly bitten by the big beast．

    (比尔正用他的大拳头打一头大野兽，但他的大拳头被这只大野兽狠狠地咬了一口。)

    不仅元音如此，相似的辅音也能编成绕口令进行对比训练，如［t］和［t∫］：

    This is a Kitten in the kitchen．

    In the kitchen I fry the chicken．

    A fly flies into the kitchen while I frv the chicken．(厨房里有一只小猫，我在厨房做炸鸡，当我在做炸鸡时，一只苍蝇飞进厨房。)

    三、发挥绕口令的识别作用

    在准确掌握每个音素的基础上，把一些易混淆的音素放进具体的语言环境中，让口腔等发音器官识别 每一个音素。绕口令则能够很好地满足这一要求，充分锻炼各个发音器官的灵活性。如教学实践中，象这些元音，学生往往  感到难以掌握，笔者就让他们练凑下面的绕口令，从慢到快，循序渐进，效果颇佳。

    Betty botter bought some butter，(贝蒂布特买了些黄油，)

    But she said，the butter’S bitter．(但是她说黄油有点苦。)

    If I put it in my batter，(如果我把它放进甜饼糊，)

    it will make my batter bitter．(它会使甜饼糊变苦。)

    But a bit of butter butter，(但加人一点儿较好的黄油，)

    will make my batter better．(就会使甜饼糊味道更好。)

    So she bought a bit of butter，(于是她又买了一点儿黄油，)

    better than her bitter butter．(味道比她的苦黄油更好。)

    And she put it in her batter，(她把它放进甜饼糊，)

    and the batter was not bitter．(甜饼糊也不苦了。)

    Sot was better Betty botter bought a bit 0f better butter．

    (因此贝蒂布特买较好的黄油是更好的选择。)

        通过统口令的练习，不仅能够提高语言的发音准确程度，更能提高学生的会话能力。由于英语相对于汉语的独特性，初学者往往觉得说英语别扭，舌头拐不过弯儿。 通过英语绕口令的强化练习，学生们的发声器官变得更加灵活，会话能力很快提高，更增强了学习英语的兴趣。下边一段绕口令可用于进行综合练习：

       Good cookies could be cooked by a good cook，if a good cook could cook good cookies．(如果一个好厨师能烤出好面包，那就让他来烤面包。)

        编写英语绕1：21令，多多练习一些英语绕口令，学习者的英语会话水平一定会有意想不到的进步。

巧用英语绕口令   


在高一英语的教学当中发现，学生在语音这一方面存在很多问题。比如，不会音标，部分音标发音不标准，导致单词读不对，读不准；不敢开口说英语，英语口语水平很差，甚至因此提不起对英语的学习兴趣。这是由多方面的原因造成的。
    
尽快提高学生的语音水平，对高中阶段的英语学习有很大帮助。提高语音水平有很多方法，在这里提供一个简单有效的方法：让学生多练习一些英语绕口令。
    
比方说：She sells seashells by the sea shore. The shells she sells are surely seashells. So if she sells shells on the seashore, I'm sure she sells seashore shells. 
    
Silly Sally swiftly shooed seven silly sheep. The seven silly sheep Silly Sally shooed shilly-shallied south. These sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack; sheep should sleep in a shed.
    
在练习时首先写出绕口令的音标，读准每个单词的发音，然后慢读，逐渐加快速度，还可以让学生比赛，看谁说的又快又准。这样不但容易激发学生学习英语的积极性，还有利于提高他们对英语的兴趣。

绕口令
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Where's the peck of picked peppers Peter Piper picked?

Betty bought a bit of butter,"but" said she,"this butter is bitter, if I put it in my batter,it will make my batter bitter."
So she bought some better butter,better than the bitter butter,and it made her bitter batter better.

Bill had billboard,
Bill also had a boare bill,
The board bill bored Bill,
So Bill sold the billboard to pay his board bill,
And the board bill no longer bored Bill.


# 说明

绕口令部分，了解读一读，应该也是蛮有用的。
